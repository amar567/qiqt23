        "Title": "Kittens, cats and compasses: superposing coherent states for quantum sensing, quantum communication, quantum computing and quantum fun",
        "Abstract": "Glauber coherent states are semiclassical in the sense that that follow classical harmonic-oscillator dynamics and are minimum-uncertainty states. A superposition of two macroscopically distinct coherent states is a Schr\u00f6dinger cat state (alive and dead in superposition) and a kitten if not macroscopically distinct. Superposing two- and multi-mode coherent states is an entangled coherent state. Geometric intution arises through quasiprobability representations, allowing talk about superposing coherent states on a line (relevant to bosonic qubits) and on a circle (e.g., compass states). I present this potted history followed by our proposal for making a nuclear cat state arXiv:2304.13813"
