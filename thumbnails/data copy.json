Recent remarkable theoretical and experimental progress in our ability to measure and manipulate the quantum states of microwave photons is leading to novel applications ranging from accelerating dark matter searches to quantum error correction that, for the first time in any technology, has successfully extended the lifetime of quantum information. Small bosonic quantum simulators now exist which use boson sampling to compute optical vibronic spectra of triatomic molecules. This talk will present an elementary introduction to the basic concepts underlying circuit QED and describe several recent novel experiments demonstrating these newfound capabilities."

        "Abstract": "A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. In this talk I will introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and I argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. I will then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of my arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics. My talk is based on a joint work with Mark Wilde, Sarah Brandsen, and Isabelle Jianing Geng, and is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14424"

To avoid such inconsistent predictions in quantum theory, we will consider two distinct perspectives - \"absoluteness of measurement (AoM)\" and \"non-absoluteness of measurement (NoM)\" - about the objective status of the measurement process. We will discuss why the set of probabilities obtainable for NoM is strictly larger than for AoM. Remarkably, in the scenario with spatially separated observers, we will see a strict hierarchy among the sets of probabilities observed in the following three theories: classical or local realist, quantum theory with AoM, and quantum theory with NoM. Finally, we will briefly talk about different interpretations of quantum theory based on the perceptions of AoM/NoM and whether they lead to consistent predictions. The talk will be based on PRA 107, 022226 (2023)."

To achieve it, any information processing system needs an initial supply of resources away from thermal equilibrium. In this talk, I will discuss the in-principle limits on the accuracy achievable with a given amount of nonequilibrium resources. Specifically, I will present a limit based on an entropic quantity, named the reverse entropy, associated to a time reversal of the information processing task under consideration. The limit is achievable for all deterministic classical computations and for all their quantum extensions. As an application, I will show the optimal tradeoffs between nonequilibrium and accuracy for thel tasks of storing, transmitting, cloning, and erasing information. These results set a target for the design of new devices approaching the ultimate efficiency limit, and provide a framework for demonstrating thermodynamical advantages of genuine quantum information processing."

We investigate the usefulness adaptive methods in the framework of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel and observing outputs. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is a fundamental distinction between adaptive and nonadaptive strategies with respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test strategies. The following main results are obtained: (1) We prove that for classical-quantum channels, adaptive and nonadaptive strategies lead to the same error exponents both in the symmetric (Chernoff) and asymmetric (Hoeffding, Stein) settings. (2) The first separation between adaptive and nonadaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for nonadaptive strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking channels. I will also discuss applications of these results and open questions. \nReferences: \n1. Farzin Salek, Masahito Hayashi, and AW. Phys. Rev. A 105, 022419 (2022).\n2. Aram W.

On the other hand, prominent examples of transition in chaos in classical dynamical systems are the stochastic synchronization transitions (ST). In this case, classical trajectories starting from different initial conditions synchronize when subjected to sufficiently strong common random stochastic noise. In this talk, I will establish a direct link between MIPT and ST by considering models of interacting quantum particles, whose positions are measured continuously, albeit weakly. In the semiclassical limit, the dynamics of the system is described by a stochastic Langevin equation where the noise and the dissipation terms are both controlled by the small quantum parameter and measurement strength. I will show the existence of a chaotic-to-non-chaotic transition in the Langevin evolution as a function of either interaction or noise/dissipation strength."

        "Title": "Quantum homogenization in Marovian and non-Markovian collisional models",
        "Abstract": "Collisional models are a category of microscopic framework designed to study dynamics of open quantum systems. The framework involves a system sequentially interacting with a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Such a simple-minded model of system-bath interaction has the potentiality of providing answers to several fundamental questions regarding the system's behavior. In the present talk, we will first discuss about the homogenization process of a system qubit when it sequentially interacts with the individual bath qubits via partial swap operations. We will then discuss about the homogenization process for the system qubit in the non-Markovian collisional model framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial swap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we will show that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states of the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario, where partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer. On the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than its Markovian counter part. Interestingly, a different choice of bath-bath unitary speeds up the homogenization process but loses the universality being dependent on the initial states of the bath units. In our process, we will show a regime of transition of non-Markovian dynamics to Markovian dynamics (and vice-versa)."

        "Abstract": "Consider two interacting systems when one is treated classically while the other remains quantum. There is a famous no-go argument against such interactions due to Feynman and Aharonov, and I'll explain how it doesn't apply to theories which are indeterministic. Consistent classical-quantum dynamics exist, and we can derive its most general form. We apply this framework to general relativity, and present a consistent theory of classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. If any system is treated as fundamentally classical, the dynamics necessarily results in decoherence of quantum systems, and a breakdown in predictability in classical phase space. We prove that a trade-off between the rate of decoherence and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general feature of all classical-quantum dynamics. When the trade-off is saturated, the quantum state remains pure conditioned on the classical trajectory and the measurement postulate and Born rule is not needed. Applying the trade-off, we find a relationship between the strength of gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter.\n\nBased on joint work with Carlo Sparaciari, Barbara \u0160oda & Zachary Weller-Davies\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03116\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01982\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07283"

Finding a good expectation value for an observable is often sufficient for many problems of interest in quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, combinatorial optimization, many-body physics etc. A set of methods, collectively called quantum error mitigation, has been studied to extract noise-free expectation values from a noisy device. In this talk, we shall go over a well-known and simple quantum error mitigation method, namely Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). While ZNE is treacherously simple in theory, it is often a challenge to work with it in real scenarios. We shall discuss the best practices for using ZNE and stress upon the importance of partial folding for larger circuits and its implementation method. Moreover, there are some types of noise for which ZNE does not provide any improvement - thus lowering its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We show that ZNE, when combined with measurement error mitigation and twirling, can overcome these shortcomings. We conclude by giving some insight into the choice of extrapolator and their effectiveness for this method.\n\nReference: R. Majumdar, P. Rivero, D. Wang.

Although in small quantum devices, the noise is assumed to be uncorrelated (Markovian) this assumption fails as the size and complexity increase, and the various system-environment interactions become correlated (non-Markovian).\nWe present a method of full quantum process tomography that captures non-Markovian noise and a method to detect quantum memory in a non-Markovian process [1]. We call a process Markovian when the environment does not provide a memory that retains correlations across different system-environment interactions. We define two types of non-Markovian processes, depending on the required memory being classical or quantum. We formalise this distinction using the process matrix formalism, through which a process is represented as a multipartite state. Within this formalism, a test for entanglement in the state can be mapped to a test for quantum memory in the process.\nWe demonstrate the method in a simple toy model, but our methods have been applied experimentally, too, in photonics [2] and superconducting qubits [3].\n[1] C.

In our scheme, neither a physical bilayer nor twist is directly realized. Instead, two synthetic layers are produced exploiting coherently-coupled internal atomic states, and a supercell structure is generated via a spatially-dependent Raman coupling.

        "Abstract": "For more than 60 years, the Schawlow-Townes limit [1] was thought to limit the laser coherence \u212d \u2013\u2013 the number of photons emitted from the laser into the beam in one coherence time \u2013\u2013 to a scaling O(\u03bc^2), where \u03bc is the mean number of optical-frequency excitations stored inside the laser. However, recently it has been shown [2,3] that this is just a standard quantum limit (SQL).\nThe Heisenberg limit \u2013\u2013 an achievable ultimate limit set by quantum mechanics for the task of producing a beam with the standard properties of a laser beam \u2013\u2013 is \u212d = O(\u03bc^4), a quadratic enhancement [2,3]. So far, proposals to demonstrate beyond-SQL scaling of \u212d have been limited to circuit QED, at microwave frequencies (i.e. a maser) [2,4]. Here we present the first optical- frequency laser platform that can surpass the Schawlow-Townes scaling: a super-radiant laser in the bad-cavity limit with feedback-controlled collective pumping. We show that the coherence can exhibit a scaling as large as \u212d ~ \u03bc^8/3, where here \u03bc \u2248 N/2, where N is the number of super-radiant atoms. Using atoms with an ultranarrow clock transition (mHz), we predict that a laser linewidth (the reciprocal of the coherence time) below 100 \u03bcHz could be attainable. This is more than an order of magnitude below standard super-radiant lasers, where the linewidth is limited to the transition width.\n[1] A. L. Schawlow and C. H.

        "Title": "System dependent random matrix ensembles: mathematical tools for many body quantum information analysis",
        "Abstract": "For systems that can be described mathematically, physical information can be derived, in principle, from detailed knowledge of the operators that govern their evolution. Physical systems can however be complex in nature and it is not always possible to determine the operator exactly or, even if they are known, to solve the equations they determine.\nThe complexity of a system e.g one with many body interactions, in general, makes it difficult to determine some or almost all matrix elements (even in absence of disorder). The lack of accuracy acts as a source of randomness for the matrix elements and it can be modeled by a random matrix (with some or all random entries). While the statistical behavior of many body systems in ergodic regime can be well-modeled by the stationary random matrix ensembles, the non-ergodic regime requires consideration of system-dependent random matrix ensembles: those which can take into account the physical constraints on the system e.g. local interactions, dimensionality, symmetry, local conservation laws. For example, the combined effect of nearest neighbor interactions and dimensionality can lead to a sparse random matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a basis of interest, with sparsity and nature of randomness dependent on system-specific details.\nThe statistical analysis of various many body systems requires, therefore, a thorough probing of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles which is not an easy task. The theoretical analysis is further complicated by the fluctuation of accuracy due to varying system conditions causing multi parametric evolution of the matrix elements. Fortunately we are able to show that, for single-well potentials, it is possible to identify a function of all distribution parameters, seemingly a measure of average uncertainty and therefore referred as the complexity parameter, in terms of which the multi-parametric evolution can be reduced to a single parametric one. As a consequence, the evolution of the statistical properties of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles can be described by a common mathematical formulation where system information enters through the complexity parameter only. This in turn suggests a possible classification of complex systems in an infinite range of universality classes characterized just by the complexity parameter and the nature of global physical constraints e.g. symmetries and conservation laws. The complexity parametric formulation of the statistical properties not only helps in technical simplification (one can apply results available for one complex system to another if they have same complexity parameter and global constraints), it also indicates a web of connection hidden underneath complex systems even in non-ergodic regime, thereby generalising the previously known universality in complex systems in ergodic regime).\n.\nReferences\n\nP.

In this talk we demonstrate the emergence of fracton conservation laws in a hole-doped collinear antiferromagnet in two dimensions.

We discuss possible experimental realizations of these observations."

        "Abstract": "Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, the bunching of two indistinguishable photons on a balanced beam-splitter, has emerged as a promising tool for quantum sensing. The interference dip-width, thus the spectral bandwidth of interfering pair-photons, highly influences the resolution of HOM-based sensors. Typically, the photon-pairs bandwidth, generated through parametric down-conversion, is increased using bulky and expensive ultrafast lasers, limiting their use outside the lab. We show the generation of photon pairs with flexible spectral bandwidth even using single-frequency, continuous-wave diode laser enabling high-precision, real-time sensing. Using a 1-mm-long periodically-poled KTP crystal, we produced degenerate, high-brightness photon pairs with a high spectral bandwidth resulting in a narrow HOM-dip to measure a displacement of 60 nm and vibration amplitude of 205 nm at a frequency of 8 Hz. Finally, we used the HOM interferometer to measure the temperature-dependent refractive index of nonlinear crystals as part of real-time, precision-augmented, in-field quantum sensing applications. In the current talk, I will explain the basics and our recent results on HOM interferometer-based quantum sensing results in detail."

An analytical variational ansatz allows us to obtain the phase diagrams of the superfluid and droplet phases. The crossover from the superfluid to the supersolid phase and to single and droplet arrays is probed with particle number and dipolar interaction. The dipolar strength is tuned by rotating the magnetic field with subsequent effects on phase boundaries. Following interaction quenches across the aforementioned phases, we monitor the dynamical formation of supersolid clusters or droplet lattices.\r\n\r\nRecent realization of binary dipolar BEC opens new exciting aspects for studying quantum droplets and supersolids in a binary mixture. Relying on the three-dimensional numerical simulations in the extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework, I discuss our findings of the groundstate phase diagrams and characterize different groundstate phases. The emergent phases include both miscible and immiscible single droplets (SD), multiple droplets (MD), supersolid (SS), and superfluid (SF) states. More intriguing mixed groundstates occur for an imbalanced binary mixture, including a combination of SS-SF, SS-MD, and SS-SS phases. Following linear quenches of intra-species scattering lengths across the aforementioned phases, I demonstrate the dynamical formation of supersolid clusters and droplet lattices.

The sharpness of the interference that the quanton can produce is constrained by the distinguishability of the two paths. However there exist other kinds of quantum phenomena where interference of two-particle amplitudes results in a two-particle interference, if the particles are indistinguishable. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) effects are two well known examples. We will argue that the HOM and the HBT effects are not two distinct effects, as is usually believed. Instead there is a single phenomenon underlying both, which rests on the indistinguishability of particles, much the same way as single-particle interference rests on the indistinguishability of the two paths the particle takes. In fact, we will show that a duality relation, between particle distinguishability and the visibility of two-particle interference, can be derived. The distinguishability of the two particles, arising from some internal degree of freedom, puts a bound on the sharpness of the two-particle interference they can produce, in a HOM or HBT kind of experiment."

This is India\u2019s first satellite based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) project which aims to develop indigenous technologies for satellite based QKD towards a quantum secure future for India. Here, we will report on several milestones achieved by the QuEST project. The first involves the development of a novel, indigenous QKD simulation toolkit qkdSim [1], as well as the establishment of a prepare and measure based QKD experiment. The simulation results match well with experiment; a representative key rate and the quantum bit error rate from experiment is 51\u00b10.5 kbit/sec and 4.79%\u00b10.01% respectively, wherein the simulation yields 52.83\u00b10.36 kbit/sec and 4.79%\u00b10.01%, respectively[2]. With this, we establish a prepare and measure based QKD protocol in the lab with an indigenous novel simulation toolkit, both very important milestones towards our quest for satellite based QKD in India. We will then discuss our demonstration of free space entanglement based quantum communication between two buildings at RRI through an atmospheric channel, the first such demonstration in India, first performed in February 2021. We will then discuss our recent work on passive feedback based polarisation scrambling mitigation, a crucial requirement for long haul quantum communications [3]. One of the major challenges in long distance quantum communications is the polarization degree of freedom of single-photons getting affected while transmission through optical fibres, or atmospheric turbulence. Conventionally, an active feedback-based mechanism is employed to achieve real-time polarization tracking. In this work, we propose an alternative, less resource intensive, passive feedback based approach. As a proof-of- principle demonstration, we implement an in-lab BBM92 protocol to exemplify the performance of our technique.\nWe will end with our broad vision for the future in terms of a global quantum communication network.\n[1] An experimenter\u2019s toolkit for simulating Quantum Key Distribution protocol implementations, R.\nChatterjee, S.

In this talk, I will present some of our recent work on understanding the non-equilibrium properties of these systems. In the first part of the talk, I will propose a route to realize a discrete time crystal in a periodically driven quantum system. A time crystal is a fascinating non-equilibrium phase of matter that exhibits spontaneous time translation-symmetry breaking. I will demonstrate that a many-body interference mechanism can be harnessed to create an eternal time crystal with global \"all-to-all\" interactions. In the second part of the talk, I will describe quantum information scrambling in a chaotic spin-chain with competing short and long-range interactions. I will argue that this system can exhibit fast scrambling, thereby providing a route to probe aspects of quantum gravity in near-term experiments.

In such a scenario, the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality only self-tests the nature of the state and local observables. The inability to self-test the post-measurement state precludes the self-testing of the unsharpness parameters. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality is a result of degeneracy-breaking or preserving measurement carried out by one of the spatially separated observer.\nIn this talk I demonstrate the sequential bipartite Bell test by multiple sequential observers on one side (who perform unsharp measurements, i.e., POVMs) possess the potential to self-test the unsharpness instruments as well as the degeneracy-breaking measurements in a DI way. First, I demonstrate that there exists a trade-off between the maximum sequential quantum violations of the CHSH inequality, which form an optimal pair that enables us to robustly self- test the entangled state, the observables, and the unsharpness parameters in the DI way. Next, I show how one can certify up to what extent the degeneracy has been lifted. In particular, the protocol certifies the upper bound on the number of POVMs used for performing such measurements along with the entangled state and measurement observables. Introduce an elegant sum-of-squares approach enables us to derive the DI optimal quantum violation of Bell inequalities which is crucial in both the works."

Brain inspired Neuromorphic computing architecture integrated with in-memory computing capability could instigate unprecedented breakthroughs in AI technology. Although there has been progress in Neuromorphic computing, however, engineering the material aspect for its architecture remains a challenge. In this regard, the two- dimensional (2D) layered materials, consisting of atomically-thin layers, possess a plethora of exotic properties and have emerged as the leading contenders for the next generation of electronic devices. Specific attention has been given to the layered transition metal di- chalcogenides (TMDCs), has created numerous prospects for developing low-power electronics, cutting-edge memory device arrays and smart computing architectures with desirable miniaturization. In this talk I will discuss two approaches for achieving Neuromorphic computing with monolayer TMDCs mem-transistors; optoelectronic and thermal driven ionotronic approach. Two-dimensional TMDC transistors demonstrating optoelectronic artificial synapse and reconfigurable logic operation are fabricated. The persistent photoconductivity of these devices are used to achieve the long- short term synaptic plasticity behaviour. Furthermore, Pavlov\u2019s classical conditioning is demonstrated by using the broadband sensitivity of the devices. More importantly, reconfigurable Boolean logic gate operations are demonstrated within the same device. We also demonstrate a novel mem- transistor device using monolayer TMDCs as channel that offers multi-bit high density storage states and can perform key synaptic operations above room temperature. This novel integration of memory, synaptic behaviour, and processing within a single monolayer TMDC device put forth a new horizon for the Non-Von-Neuman type in-memory computing architecture for advanced AI applications at room temperature and beyond."

        "Abstract": "In this talk we shall briefly review the concept of geometric phase following the trail of Pancharatnam. Subsequently we shall see that the notion of geometric phase so defined is not unique, and there exists a natural operator generalisation of this notion. It will be shown that in scenarios wherein the usual geometric phase is not defined, the generalised geometric phase manifests as a global phase acquired by a quantum state in course of time evolution. The generalised geometric phase is found to contribute to the shift in the energy spectrum due perturbation, and to the forward scattering amplitude in a scattering problem."

We will focus on two specific applications. First, on generating maximally entangled single-particle states(MESPS) via discrete-time quantum walks on some cyclic graphs. We will see that MESPS can be generated using single coins, implying a resource-saving experimental implementation. Secondly, we will show that we can improve the Google page rank algorithm by taking recourse to quantum stochastic walks. Using a varied array of different networks, especially those with small-world features, we will show that the quantum version of the page rank algorithm is better at resolving degeneracies, a bane of any search algorithm. <br/>The talk will be based on the following papers:<br/>1.

        "Abstract": "It is a fundamental prediction of quantum theory that states of physical systems are described by complex vectors or density operators on a Hilbert space. However, many experiments admit effective descriptions in terms of other state spaces, such as classical probability distributions or quantum systems with superselection rules. Here, we ask which probabilistic theories could reasonably be found as effective descriptions of physical systems if nature is fundamentally quantum. To this end, we employ a generalized version of noncontextuality: processes that are statistically indistinguishable in an effective theory should not require explanation by multiple distinguishable processes in a more fundamental theory. We formulate this principle in terms of embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude of fundamental results on the exact and approximate embedding of theories (in particular into quantum theory). We show how results on Bell inequalities can be used for the robust certification of this generalized notion of contextuality. From this, we propose an experimental test of quantum theory by probing single physical systems without assuming access to a tomographically complete set of procedures, arguably avoiding a significant loophole of earlier approaches.\n\nBased on joint work with Andrew J.

Such sensors can be based on unitary systems like various types of interferometers or open systems based on scattering and lossy transmission channels. The framework of the quantum Fisher information enables one to obtain best estimates of the parameters and then one can design possible experiments that can reach Cramer- Rao bounds. I would highlight not only the importance of the quantum states used as probes, but also the importance of the quantum-ness of the measurement schemes. The time reversed metrology can be realized by SU11 interferometers. I would bring out the especial importance of the squeezed states of matter and light for metrology and show how the time reversed metrology can saturate Cramer -Rao bounds in many cases."

We show that measurement incompatibility is necessary for quantum advantage in any classical communication task of arbitrary dimension in the prepare and measure scenario. We formulate a witness to certify incompatibility in a semi-device-independent manner. We next show that for any quantum state and observables of sufficiently small dimensions producing contextuality, there exists a communication task with quantum advantage. In the state independent contextual framework, we demonstrate that the difference between classical and quantum communication complexities increases as the number of inputs grows. Finally, it is shown how to convert each of these communication tasks into a semi-device-independent protocol for quantum key distribution.\nRefs:\n(1) D. Saha, D. Das, A. K. Das, B. Bhattacharya, A.

        "Abstract": "Modern quantum machine learning (QML) methods involve variationally optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit on a training data set, and subsequently making predictions on a testing data set (i.e., generalizing). In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number N of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as sqrt(T/N). When only K<<T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to sqrt(K/N). Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data."

It is hoped that laser schemes can be applied to achieve optimal performances by overcoming these problems. This would be a step forward to realizing a practical quantum network.\n\n We have developed a unified quantum theoretical framework that describes the photon dynamics and the essential mechanisms of photon interactions with f-center molecules in phonon and radiation baths. We will discuss molecular Raman schemes with control by laser pulses. This is built on our long-time studies in laser cooling of molecules and effort in developing full quantum Heisenberg-Langevin theory for nonclassical correlations of photon pairs in double Raman scheme; from single atom to two atoms with dipole-dipole interactions, one dimensional extended medium in co-propagating and counter-propagating geometries, spherical microparticle and plasmonic systems.

        "Title": "Implementing Linear Combination of Unitaries on Intermediate-term Quantum Computers",
        "Abstract": "Over the years, the framework of Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) has been extremely useful for designing optimal quantum algorithms for a wide variety of problems. However, the standard approach for implementing LCU requires a large number of ancilla qubits, as well as the ability to implement sophisticated controlled operations, leading to a large circuit depth. Thus, this broadly applicable quantum algorithmic paradigm is only useful for fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are decades away. In this talk, I will describe a randomized quantum algorithm that can implement any LCU by repeatedly sampling from a short-depth quantum circuit, and using only a single ancilla qubit. This algorithm can be run using early fault-tolerant quantum computers -- quantum devices that are expected to be available immediately after the current Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum stage, characterized by short circuit-depth and a limited number of logical qubits. I will apply this method to problems of wide applicability: estimation of the expectation value of any observable with respect to the ground states of Hamiltonians and the solution of quantum linear systems. This leads to novel quantum algorithms for these problems, which are less resource-demanding than the prior art, while remarkably, still retaining a provable quantum advantage. I will also briefly explore: (i) the possibility of implementing any LCU without any ancilla qubits and (ii) other intermediate-term quantum hardware possibilities that go beyond the circuit model and implement LCU using hybrid qubit-qumode systems. Overall, these techniques can be applied to develop quantum algorithms for several problems, with performance guarantees, tailored to intermediate-term quantum computers."

Photonic qubits, where\ninformation is encoded in the quantum state of the photons are an ideal choice for some of these applications, due to their speed, robustness and ease of manipulation. In particular, polarization- entangled photon pairs, due to their high entanglement purity and relative simplicity of generation, are key elements for many quantum communication protocols, such as quantum networks, quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation. Nonlinear optical techniques like spontaneous parametric\ndown conversion (SPDC) and four wave mixing (FWM) are widely used for their generation in bulk\ncrystals or waveguides. While bulk crystals are preferable for free-space optical QC experiments, all-\nfiber and WDM-based waveguide sources are more suitable for fiber-based QC experiments.\nCovering these aspects, I will talk about the recent endeavors of our group and results from our Quantum Photonics Lab."

        "Abstract": "Simulations using atomic gases on optical lattice is one of the most intensively studied research fields at present. It allows quantum simulations of various important strongly-correlated many-body systems for which the conventional methods cannot be applied. I will discuss about the effects of lattice geometries, inter-particle interactions and spatial inhomogeneity due to harmonic trap on the quantum vortex states of strongly interacting bosons in rotating two-dimensional optical lattice. The system is modelled by an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Using the numerical exact diagonalization technique, it will be shown how the rotation introduces vortex states of various ground state symmetries and transition between these states at discrete rotation frequencies. I will also discuss how the optical lattice of various symmetries plays crucial roles in determining the maximum number of vortex states as well as the general characteristics of these quantum vortex states, such as the average angular momentum, the current at the perimeter of the lattice, phase winding, the maximum lattice current and also the saturation of the maximum lattice current between neighbouring lattice sites.

In this talk, quantum networks are considered in the device-independent scenario where devices are seen as quantum back boxes processing classical information. We first show how the characterization of correlations in quantum networks is related to the study of causal networks. We then present several results illustrating the possibilities these networks offer in the foundations of quantum physics or for the development of quantum information technologies. In the first case, we show how real quantum theory can be falsified in a small network consisting of three observers in an entanglement swapping configuration. In the second, we discuss a scheme to self-test any pure entangled state."

After leading the EPR paradox, we will highlight that entangled beams are not only crucial for fundamental sciences, but also useful to encode information in the distribution of the spatial correlations of entangled twin beams. Such encoded information can only be extracted through joint spatial measurements of the twin beams and not through individual beam measurements, and the temporal quantum correlations are not modified.\n\nRefs.\n1.

It is found that the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry (SUSY) happens in PT symmetric domain where, non trivial shape invariance is needed to obtain the energy spectra. On the other hand, SUSY remains intact in PT broken phase and states with zero width resonance arises for integral value of potential parameters. We also discuss about the isospctral deformation which is one of the important features of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Here, we show that the supersymmetric partners of the free particle, under general boundary condition, lead to the breather and complex soliton, which satisfy the KdV equation, with an emergent PT \u2212symmetry."

        "Abstract": "The capacities of noisy quantum channels capture the ultimate rates of information transmission across quantum communication lines, and the quantum capacity plays a key role in determining the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation platforms. In the case of bosonic systems, central to many applications, no closed formulas for these capacities were known for bosonic dephasing channels, a key class of non-Gaussian channels modelling, e.g., noise affecting superconducting circuits or fiber-optic communication channels. Here we provide the first exact calculation of the quantum, private, two-way assisted quantum, and secret-key agreement capacities of all bosonic dephasing channels. We prove that they are equal to the relative entropy of the distribution underlying the channel to the uniform distribution.

The uncertainty principle itself rather generates a bound for maximally achievable quantum synchronization, when defined in terms of the uncertainties of the joint quadratures. We will discuss whether this arises from the same EPR correlation that gives rise to entanglement between two oscillators, in a cavity optomechanical set up. We will also point out the limitations and bottlenecks of our main idea: entanglement is a sufficient condition for quantum synchronization.\r"

We present two results - firstly, we present a protocol for extraction of randomness from a single min-entropy source (consisting of two blocks of sufficiently high min-entropy) and show a proof of security of the protocol against quantum adversaries (who may hold a quantum memory correlated with the devices). Secondly, we present a protocol for randomness amplification of a specific class of Santha-Vazirani sources for which we show a proof against more general adversaries limited only by the no-signalling principle of relativity. We discuss the feasibility of experimental implementation of the protocols in terms of noise robustness, generation rates, number of devices, and implications for foundational tests of Bell non-locality.

        "Abstract": "To provide unconditional security to the keys, and subsequently to the message, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) comes to the rescue. QKD is one of the most ubiquitous applications of quantum mechanics in modern times. Though QKD provides unconditional security, its practical implementation deviates from the ideal one, affecting the security of key. In this talk, we will discuss the techniques to improve the key rates for BB84 and BBM92 QKD protocol and methods to characterize implementation loopholes that make it vulnerable against the side channel attacks. For increasing the key rate using weak coherent laser pulses, we introduce a novel quantum key distribution protocol, called coincidence detection quantum key distribution protocol (CD Protocol). We show that the Poissonian nature of weak coherent pulses instead of posing a security risk can be used to achieve a secure key rate higher than the standard GLLP and decoy state QKD protocols. Prepare and measure protocols such as BB84 consider the satellite as a trusted device, which is fraught with danger looking at the current trend for satellite based optical communication.Therefore, entanglement-based QKD (EB QKD) protocols must be preferred since, along with overcoming the distance limitation, one can take the satellite as an untrusted device. The most well-known EB QKD protocol is the E91 protocol, but the achieved key rate is less as maximum of the bits are sacrificed for measuring Bell parameter. This key rate can be increased without compromising the security provided by EB QKD, if one uses the BBM92 protocol with a pre-characterized relation between S and QBER. Thus, an estimate of QBER provides a simultaneous measurement of entanglement without sacrificing the bits used in proving the Bell\u2019s inequality violation. At the end, we will discuss the current international status of the field.\nReferences\n[1] Sarika Mishra, et al., J.

The system and the apparatus evolve in time, and the Born rule for the system to be in various eigenstates of the observable is naturally obtained. In this work, we show that the effect of the drive-induced dissipation in an open quantum system can lead to\nthe Born rule, even if there is no separate apparatus. The applied drive needs to be much stronger than the system-environment coupling. In this condition, we show that the dynamics of the driven-dissipative system could be reduced to a Milburn-like form using a recently proposed fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation. The irreversible part of the dynamics is caused by drive-induced dissipation. The resulting mixed state is identical to that obtained by using the Born rule [1]. We also discuss the effect of the system-environment coupling and show that the Born rule phase appears as an intermediate quasi-steady-state under suitable driving conditions.\n[1] N Chanda, R Bhattacharyya, Emergence of the Born rule in strongly-driven dissipative systems,\nPhysical Review, A 104 (2), 022436 (2021)"

The Process Matrix Framework is one such framework that generalises quantum channels to process matrices. This framework has been vastly studied due to the direct applicability of known quantum information tools. Another framework, that chronologically preceded the process matrices is the Causaloid Framework which starts from a more general starting point and can be thought of as incorporating Generalised Probability Theories as well as Indefinite Causality. The Framework has been worked on more recently to be made more accessible. Further a hierarchy within the Causaloid Framework that is distinct from Sorkin's hierarchy, that depends on composition has been introduced. A natural question arises as to how the Process Matrix Formalism and the Causaloid Framework are related and how they can be understood through the introduced hierarchy. We answer this question by showing how the bipartite Process Matrices are a special instance in the Causaloid Framework. This work helps fill a theoretical gap in the literature and by understanding Indefinite Causality from the lens of Generalised Probability Theories helps us make attempts towards an axiomatic approach to Indefinite Causality.

Recent trends to build devices at the nano-scale and smaller require us to understand how the heat can be managed in these devices. For such a system consisting of only a few particles, which follow quantum mechanics, there is a need to reinterpret thermodynamics in the quantum regime. The thermodynamics no longer remains a concept based on ensemble average and the quantum properties of individual particles come to the forefront. In this talk, we will first redefine the various thermodynamic parameters in the quantum domain and then focus toward implementation of quantum thermal machines (QTM). We will discuss in detail about the implementation of different stages of a QTM, particularly an Otto engine, which interacts with two baths sequentially. It is often assumed that these baths can be switched on or off in a controlled manner which could be very challenging experimentally as the heat bath is always on at the quantum level. In this talk I will discuss how a quantum Otto engine in a trapped ion setup works in an 'always-on' bath condition. We show how the post-selective measurement to the ground state of the quantum system works as a cold bath which provides an experimentally feasible model for implementing the QTM."

        "Abstract": "We demonstrated that among all quantum teleportation protocols designed for initial random pure qubit states, those with aligned Bloch vectors between input and output states exhibit the minimum average trace distance, provided a fixed average fidelity. These are optimal protocols for a given average fidelity. Futhermore, we show these protocols have null fidelity deviation and can be intepreted as the perfect quantum teleportation protocol under the action of correlated one-qubit channels on Alice's qubits. In particular, we focused on deterministic protocols, wherein the final Bloch vector length is equal for all measurement outcomes. Within these protocols, there exists one corresponding to the action of uncorrelated channels on Alice's qubits. These channels correspond to depolarization channels, and we have studied their characteristics in detail.\n\nAuthors: Fabricio Toscano, D. G. Bussardi, Gustavo M. Bosyk, A. P.

The signature of underlying classicality in quantum dynamics is revealed from the entanglement spectrum, which also elucidates the formation of quantum scars of unstable steady states and of periodic orbits exhibiting athermal behavior. The degree of ergodicity across the energy band and scarring phenomena can be probed from the autocorrelation function as well from the phase fluctuation of the condensates, which has relevance in cold atom experiments."

        "Abstract": "We discuss the implications of the principle of locality for interference in quantum field theory. As an example, we consider the interaction of two charges via a mediating quantum field and the resulting interference pattern, in the Lorenz gauge. We propose that detecting relative phases or entanglement between two charges in an interference experiment is equivalent to accessing empirically the gauge degrees of freedom associated with the so-called ghost (scalar) modes of the field in the Lorenz gauge. These results imply that ghost modes are measurable and hence physically relevant, contrary to what is usually thought. They also raise interesting questions about the relation between the principle of locality and the principle of gauge-invariance. Our analysis applies also to linearised quantum gravity in the harmonic gauge, and hence has implications for the recently proposed entanglement-based witnesses of non-classicality in gravity."

The target is illuminated using the signal while simulta- neously retaining idler modes. Classical correlation between the sent and retained idler modes is seen to provide performance gain in comparison with using only the single-mode signal to illuminate, and this is illustrated through examples. Examples of multi-mode Gaussian classical correlated states that have high degree of correlation between the sent and idler modes are seen to have performance gain over two-mode Gaussian states which are entangled in the sent and idler mode, with the sent mode being identical in both the situations."

        "Abstract": "We propose an interpretation of physics named potential realism. This view, which can be applied to classical as well as to quantum physics, regards potentialities (i.e. intrinsic, objective propensities for individual events to obtain) as elements of reality. This allows one to naturally reconcile realism and fundamental indeterminism in any theoretical framework. We discuss our specific interpretation of propensities, that require them to depart from being probabilities at the formal level, though allowing for statistics and the law of large numbers. This view helps reconcile classical and quantum physics by showing that most of the conceptual problems that are customarily taken to be unique issues of the latter \u2013such as the measurement problem\u2013, are actually in common to all indeterministic physical theories."

        "Abstract": "We provide the optimal measurement strategy for a class of noisy channels that reduce to the identity channel for a specific value of a parameter (spreading channels). We provide an example that is physically relevant: the estimation of the absolute value of the displacement in the presence of phase randomizing noise. Surprisingly, this noise does not affect the effectiveness of the optimal measurement. We show that, for small displacement, a squeezed vacuum probe field is optimal among strategies with same average energy. A squeezer followed by photodetection is the optimal detection strategy that attains the quantum Fisher information, whereas the customarily used homodyne detection becomes useless in the limit of small displacements, due to the same effect that gives Rayleigh's curse in optical superresolution. There is a quantum advantage: a squeezed or a Fock state with N average photons allow to asymptotically estimate the parameter with a sqrt(N) better precision than classical states with same energy."

These conditions are shown to be independent but not sufficient. We discuss their satisfiability and classify all possible input-output pairs of sets accordingly. We also prove that strict inclusions hold between LOCC, separable, and positive partial transpose operations for set transformation problems."

We work out conditions on the interaction Hamiltonian and structure of the problem."

We further discuss recent progress in untapping these benefits for practical quantum-enhanced imaging and sensing tasks."
