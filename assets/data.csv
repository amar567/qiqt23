Such sensors can be based on unitary systems like various types of interferometers or open systems based on scattering and lossy transmission channels. The framework of the quantum Fisher information enables one to obtain best estimates of the parameters and then one can design possible experiments that can reach Cramer- Rao bounds. I would highlight not only the importance of the quantum states used as probes, but also the importance of the quantum-ness of the measurement schemes. The time reversed metrology can be realized by SU11 interferometers. I would bring out the especial importance of the squeezed states of matter and light for metrology and show how the time reversed metrology can saturate Cramer -Rao bounds in many cases."

A superposition of two macroscopically distinct coherent states is a Schrödinger cat state (alive and dead in superposition) and a kitten if not macroscopically distinct. Superposing two- and multi-mode coherent states is an entangled coherent state. Geometric intution arises through quasiprobability representations, allowing talk about superposing coherent states on a line (relevant to bosonic qubits) and on a circle (e.g., compass states).

As an example, we consider the interaction of two charges via a mediating quantum field and the resulting interference pattern, in the Lorenz gauge. We propose that detecting relative phases or entanglement between two charges in an interference experiment is equivalent to accessing empirically the gauge degrees of freedom associated with the so-called ghost (scalar) modes of the field in the Lorenz gauge. These results imply that ghost modes are measurable and hence physically relevant, contrary to what is usually thought. They also raise interesting questions about the relation between the principle of locality and the principle of gauge-invariance. Our analysis applies also to linearised quantum gravity in the harmonic gauge, and hence has implications for the recently proposed entanglement-based witnesses of non-classicality in gravity."

In this talk, quantum networks are considered in the device-independent scenario where devices are seen as quantum back boxes processing classical information. We first show how the characterization of correlations in quantum networks is related to the study of causal networks. We then present several results illustrating the possibilities these networks offer in the foundations of quantum physics or for the development of quantum information technologies. In the first case, we show how real quantum theory can be falsified in a small network consisting of three observers in an entanglement swapping configuration. In the second, we discuss a scheme to self-test any pure entangled state."

However, recently it has been shown [2,3] that this is just a standard quantum limit (SQL).
The Heisenberg limit –– an achievable ultimate limit set by quantum mechanics for the task of producing a beam with the standard properties of a laser beam –– is ℭ = O(μ^4), a quadratic enhancement [2,3]. So far, proposals to demonstrate beyond-SQL scaling of ℭ have been limited to circuit QED, at microwave frequencies (i.e. a maser) [2,4]. Here we present the first optical- frequency laser platform that can surpass the Schawlow-Townes scaling: a super-radiant laser in the bad-cavity limit with feedback-controlled collective pumping. We show that the coherence can exhibit a scaling as large as ℭ ~ μ^8/3, where here μ ≈ N/2, where N is the number of super-radiant atoms. Using atoms with an ultranarrow clock transition (mHz), we predict that a laser linewidth (the reciprocal of the coherence time) below 100 μHz could be attainable. This is more than an order of magnitude below standard super-radiant lasers, where the linewidth is limited to the transition width.

The sharpness of the interference that the quanton can produce is constrained by the distinguishability of the two paths. However there exist other kinds of quantum phenomena where interference of two-particle amplitudes results in a two-particle interference, if the particles are indistinguishable. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) effects are two well known examples. We will argue that the HOM and the HBT effects are not two distinct effects, as is usually believed. Instead there is a single phenomenon underlying both, which rests on the indistinguishability of particles, much the same way as single-particle interference rests on the indistinguishability of the two paths the particle takes. In fact, we will show that a duality relation, between particle distinguishability and the visibility of two-particle interference, can be derived. The distinguishability of the two particles, arising from some internal degree of freedom, puts a bound on the sharpness of the two-particle interference they can produce, in a HOM or HBT kind of experiment."

Many quantum memory schemes have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally but there are limitations, especially with regard to practicality and scalability. We will discuss our work towards molecular quantum memory which have been regarded as formidable due to the rapid decoherence and broadened molecular absorption/emission peaks. It is hoped that laser schemes can be applied to achieve optimal performances by overcoming these problems. This would be a step forward to realizing a practical quantum network.

 We have developed a unified quantum theoretical framework that describes the photon dynamics and the essential mechanisms of photon interactions with f-center molecules in phonon and radiation baths. We will discuss molecular Raman schemes with control by laser pulses. This is built on our long-time studies in laser cooling of molecules and effort in developing full quantum Heisenberg-Langevin theory for nonclassical correlations of photon pairs in double Raman scheme; from single atom to two atoms with dipole-dipole interactions, one dimensional extended medium in co-propagating and counter-propagating geometries, spherical microparticle and plasmonic systems. Our current exploration is to extend these systems from atoms to generic molecules interacting with laser pulses to study storage and retrieval of photons."

Although there is evidence that spectroscopy with quantum light may have certain advantages compared to classical spectroscopic methods, this advantage has not been rigorously assessed.  We do so by theoretically calculating the precision of estimating parameters of a matter system when probed by a (travelling) pulse of quantum light. 

Concretely, we consider the estimation of matter system parameters such as its transition energy and dipole moment of an individual two-level system. To that end, we compare the performances of different quantum states of quantum light, such as single photons and entangled states of light. We also study the experimental attainability of the fundamental quantum limits of spectroscopy. 

 Our theoretical results should guide the design of quantum light spectroscopy experiments."

We shall refer to this setting as “mediated dynamics”.
The talk will give an overview of methods which operate only on the data measured on AB, and aim at revealing non-classical properties of the mediator C and its interactions.
It turns out that suitable entanglement gain between AB witnesses quantum discord to the mediator under minimalistic assumptions about the latter.
In particular, its dimension, couplings, initial state, and local environment can remain unknown.
If we remove from this list the assumption about the dimension, i.e. when the dimension of the mediator is known, 
it will be shown that sufficiently high gain of any reasonable correlation quantifier witnesses and measures non-commutativity of mediated interactions.
A number of examples in physics and biology will illustrate possible applications of these general tools."

Müller,https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT,3128,Quantum information,Title of the talk: Testing quantum theory by generalizing noncontextuality,"Abstract: It is a fundamental prediction of quantum theory that states of physical systems are described by complex vectors or density operators on a Hilbert space. However, many experiments admit effective descriptions in terms of other state spaces, such as classical probability distributions or quantum systems with superselection rules. Here, we ask which probabilistic theories could reasonably be found as effective descriptions of physical systems if nature is fundamentally quantum. To this end, we employ a generalized version of noncontextuality: processes that are statistically indistinguishable in an effective theory should not require explanation by multiple distinguishable processes in a more fundamental theory. We formulate this principle in terms of embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude of fundamental results on the exact and approximate embedding of theories (in particular into quantum theory). We show how results on Bell inequalities can be used for the robust certification of this generalized notion of contextuality. From this, we propose an experimental test of quantum theory by probing single physical systems without assuming access to a tomographically complete set of procedures, arguably avoiding a significant loophole of earlier approaches.

In this talk, we present a theoretical study of such atomic frequency combs in the strong coupling limit, using tensor-network methods. Our results demonstrate that arbitrary multi-photon states inside the cavity are almost perfectly transferred to the spin ensemble and re-emitted at periodic time intervals, with fidelity values near unity. Moreover, for a general, inhomogeneous spin ensemble, quantum information stored can still be protected from errors by using parametric, external driving."

Physical systems can however be complex in nature and it is not always possible to determine the operator exactly or, even if they are known, to solve the equations they determine.
The complexity of a system e.g one with many body interactions, in general, makes it difficult to determine some or almost all matrix elements (even in absence of disorder). The lack of accuracy acts as a source of randomness for the matrix elements and it can be modeled by a random matrix (with some or all random entries). While the statistical behavior of many body systems in ergodic regime can be well-modeled by the stationary random matrix ensembles, the non-ergodic regime requires consideration of system-dependent random matrix ensembles: those which can take into account the physical constraints on the system e.g. local interactions, dimensionality, symmetry, local conservation laws. For example, the combined effect of nearest neighbor interactions and dimensionality can lead to a sparse random matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a basis of interest, with sparsity and nature of randomness dependent on system-specific details.
The statistical analysis of various many body systems requires, therefore, a thorough probing of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles which is not an easy task. The theoretical analysis is further complicated by the fluctuation of accuracy due to varying system conditions causing multi parametric evolution of the matrix elements. Fortunately we are able to show that, for single-well potentials, it is possible to identify a function of all distribution parameters, seemingly a measure of average uncertainty and therefore referred as the complexity parameter, in terms of which the multi-parametric evolution can be reduced to a single parametric one. As a consequence, the evolution of the statistical properties of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles can be described by a common mathematical formulation where system information enters through the complexity parameter only. This in turn suggests a possible classification of complex systems in an infinite range of universality classes characterized just by the complexity parameter and the nature of global physical constraints e.g. symmetries and conservation laws. The complexity parametric formulation of the statistical properties not only helps in technical simplification (one can apply results available for one complex system to another if they have same complexity parameter and global constraints), it also indicates a web of connection hidden underneath complex systems even in non-ergodic regime, thereby generalising the previously known universality in complex systems in ergodic regime).

This view, which can be applied to classical as well as to quantum physics, regards potentialities (i.e. intrinsic, objective propensities for individual events to obtain) as elements of reality. This allows one to naturally reconcile realism and fundamental indeterminism in any theoretical framework. We discuss our specific interpretation of propensities, that require them to depart from being probabilities at the formal level, though allowing for statistics and the law of large numbers. This view helps reconcile classical and quantum physics by showing that most of the conceptual problems that are customarily taken to be unique issues of the latter –such as the measurement problem–, are actually in common to all indeterministic physical theories."

Necessary conditions for the existence of such a transformation are obtained using LOCC constraints on state transformation, entanglement, and distinguishability. These conditions are shown to be independent but not sufficient. We discuss their satisfiability and classify all possible input-output pairs of sets accordingly. We also prove that strict inclusions hold between LOCC, separable, and positive partial transpose operations for set transformation problems."

However, the standard approach for implementing LCU requires a large number of ancilla qubits, as well as the ability to implement sophisticated controlled operations, leading to a large circuit depth. Thus, this broadly applicable quantum algorithmic paradigm is only useful for fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are decades away. In this talk, I will describe a randomized quantum algorithm that can implement any LCU by repeatedly sampling from a short-depth quantum circuit, and using only a single ancilla qubit. This algorithm can be run using early fault-tolerant quantum computers -- quantum devices that are expected to be available immediately after the current Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum stage, characterized by short circuit-depth and a limited number of logical qubits. I will apply this method to problems of wide applicability: estimation of the expectation value of any observable with respect to the ground states of Hamiltonians and the solution of quantum linear systems. This leads to novel quantum algorithms for these problems, which are less resource-demanding than the prior art, while remarkably, still retaining a provable quantum advantage. I will also briefly explore: (i) the possibility of implementing any LCU without any ancilla qubits and (ii) other intermediate-term quantum hardware possibilities that go beyond the circuit model and implement LCU using hybrid qubit-qumode systems. Overall, these techniques can be applied to develop quantum algorithms for several problems, with performance guarantees, tailored to intermediate-term quantum computers."
