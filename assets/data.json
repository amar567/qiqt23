This is India\u2019s first satellite based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) project which aims to develop indigenous technologies for satellite based QKD towards a quantum secure future for India. Here, we will report on several milestones achieved by the QuEST project. The first involves the development of a novel, indigenous QKD simulation toolkit qkdSim [1], as well as the establishment of a prepare and measure based QKD experiment. The simulation results match well with experiment; a representative key rate and the quantum bit error rate from experiment is 51\u00b10.5 kbit/sec and 4.79%\u00b10.01% respectively, wherein the simulation yields 52.83\u00b10.36 kbit/sec and 4.79%\u00b10.01%, respectively[2]. With this, we establish a prepare and measure based QKD protocol in the lab with an indigenous novel simulation toolkit, both very important milestones towards our quest for satellite based QKD in India. We will then discuss our demonstration of free space entanglement based quantum communication between two buildings at RRI through an atmospheric channel, the first such demonstration in India, first performed in February 2021. We will then discuss our recent work on passive feedback based polarisation scrambling mitigation, a crucial requirement for long haul quantum communications [3]. One of the major challenges in long distance quantum communications is the polarization degree of freedom of single-photons getting affected while transmission through optical fibres, or atmospheric turbulence. Conventionally, an active feedback-based mechanism is employed to achieve real-time polarization tracking. In this work, we propose an alternative, less resource intensive, passive feedback based approach. As a proof-of- principle demonstration, we implement an in-lab BBM92 protocol to exemplify the performance of our technique.\nWe will end with our broad vision for the future in terms of a global quantum communication network.\n[1] An experimenter\u2019s toolkit for simulating Quantum Key Distribution protocol implementations, R.\nChatterjee, S.

QKD is one of the most ubiquitous applications of quantum mechanics in modern times. Though QKD provides unconditional security, its practical implementation deviates from the ideal one, affecting the security of key. In this talk, we will discuss the techniques to improve the key rates for BB84 and BBM92 QKD protocol and methods to characterize implementation loopholes that make it vulnerable against the side channel attacks. For increasing the key rate using weak coherent laser pulses, we introduce a novel quantum key distribution protocol, called coincidence detection quantum key distribution protocol (CD Protocol). We show that the Poissonian nature of weak coherent pulses instead of posing a security risk can be used to achieve a secure key rate higher than the standard GLLP and decoy state QKD protocols. Prepare and measure protocols such as BB84 consider the satellite as a trusted device, which is fraught with danger looking at the current trend for satellite based optical communication.Therefore, entanglement-based QKD (EB QKD) protocols must be preferred since, along with overcoming the distance limitation, one can take the satellite as an untrusted device. The most well-known EB QKD protocol is the E91 protocol, but the achieved key rate is less as maximum of the bits are sacrificed for measuring Bell parameter. This key rate can be increased without compromising the security provided by EB QKD, if one uses the BBM92 protocol with a pre-characterized relation between S and QBER. Thus, an estimate of QBER provides a simultaneous measurement of entanglement without sacrificing the bits used in proving the Bell\u2019s inequality violation. At the end, we will discuss the current international status of the field.\nReferences\n[1] Sarika Mishra, et al., J.

However, many experiments admit effective descriptions in terms of other state spaces, such as classical probability distributions or quantum systems with superselection rules. Here, we ask which probabilistic theories could reasonably be found as effective descriptions of physical systems if nature is fundamentally quantum. To this end, we employ a generalized version of noncontextuality: processes that are statistically indistinguishable in an effective theory should not require explanation by multiple distinguishable processes in a more fundamental theory. We formulate this principle in terms of embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude of fundamental results on the exact and approximate embedding of theories (in particular into quantum theory). We show how results on Bell inequalities can be used for the robust certification of this generalized notion of contextuality. From this, we propose an experimental test of quantum theory by probing single physical systems without assuming access to a tomographically complete set of procedures, arguably avoiding a significant loophole of earlier approaches.\n\nBased on joint work with Andrew J.

There is a famous no-go argument against such interactions due to Feynman and Aharonov, and I'll explain how it doesn't apply to theories which are indeterministic. Consistent classical-quantum dynamics exist, and we can derive its most general form. We apply this framework to general relativity, and present a consistent theory of classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. If any system is treated as fundamentally classical, the dynamics necessarily results in decoherence of quantum systems, and a breakdown in predictability in classical phase space. We prove that a trade-off between the rate of decoherence and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general feature of all classical-quantum dynamics. When the trade-off is saturated, the quantum state remains pure conditioned on the classical trajectory and the measurement postulate and Born rule is not needed. Applying the trade-off, we find a relationship between the strength of gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter.\n\nBased on joint work with Carlo Sparaciari, Barbara \u0160oda & Zachary Weller-Davies\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03116\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01982\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07283", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "JonathanOppenheim", "Name": "Prof. Jonathan Oppenheim", "Link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=BCRvXNwRVwY", "Citations": "9720", "Topic": "Quantum information"}, {"": "", "First Name": "Gilad", "Surename": "Gour", "Affiliation": "University of Calgary", "Primary email": "giladgour@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "id": "30", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/24/2023", "Time ( IST )": "9:00:00", "Title": "Inevitability of Knowing Less Than Nothing", "Abstract": "A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. In this talk I will introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and I argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. I will then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of my arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.

In such a scenario, the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality only self-tests the nature of the state and local observables. The inability to self-test the post-measurement state precludes the self-testing of the unsharpness parameters. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether the optimal violation of Bell-CHSH inequality is a result of degeneracy-breaking or preserving measurement carried out by one of the spatially separated observer.\nIn this talk I demonstrate the sequential bipartite Bell test by multiple sequential observers on one side (who perform unsharp measurements, i.e., POVMs) possess the potential to self-test the unsharpness instruments as well as the degeneracy-breaking measurements in a DI way. First, I demonstrate that there exists a trade-off between the maximum sequential quantum violations of the CHSH inequality, which form an optimal pair that enables us to robustly self- test the entangled state, the observables, and the unsharpness parameters in the DI way. Next, I show how one can certify up to what extent the degeneracy has been lifted.

Specifically, I will present a limit based on an entropic quantity, named the reverse entropy, associated to a time reversal of the information processing task under consideration. The limit is achievable for all deterministic classical computations and for all their quantum extensions. As an application, I will show the optimal tradeoffs between nonequilibrium and accuracy for thel tasks of storing, transmitting, cloning, and erasing information.

When only K<<T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to sqrt(K/N). Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set.

In this condition, we show that the dynamics of the driven-dissipative system could be reduced to a Milburn-like form using a recently proposed fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation. The irreversible part of the dynamics is caused by drive-induced dissipation. The resulting mixed state is identical to that obtained by using the Born rule [1].

Physical systems can however be complex in nature and it is not always possible to determine the operator exactly or, even if they are known, to solve the equations they determine.\nThe complexity of a system e.g one with many body interactions, in general, makes it difficult to determine some or almost all matrix elements (even in absence of disorder). The lack of accuracy acts as a source of randomness for the matrix elements and it can be modeled by a random matrix (with some or all random entries). While the statistical behavior of many body systems in ergodic regime can be well-modeled by the stationary random matrix ensembles, the non-ergodic regime requires consideration of system-dependent random matrix ensembles: those which can take into account the physical constraints on the system e.g. local interactions, dimensionality, symmetry, local conservation laws. For example, the combined effect of nearest neighbor interactions and dimensionality can lead to a sparse random matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a basis of interest, with sparsity and nature of randomness dependent on system-specific details.\nThe statistical analysis of various many body systems requires, therefore, a thorough probing of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles which is not an easy task. The theoretical analysis is further complicated by the fluctuation of accuracy due to varying system conditions causing multi parametric evolution of the matrix elements. Fortunately we are able to show that, for single-well potentials, it is possible to identify a function of all distribution parameters, seemingly a measure of average uncertainty and therefore referred as the complexity parameter, in terms of which the multi-parametric evolution can be reduced to a single parametric one. As a consequence, the evolution of the statistical properties of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles can be described by a common mathematical formulation where system information enters through the complexity parameter only. This in turn suggests a possible classification of complex systems in an infinite range of universality classes characterized just by the complexity parameter and the nature of global physical constraints e.g. symmetries and conservation laws. The complexity parametric formulation of the statistical properties not only helps in technical simplification (one can apply results available for one complex system to another if they have same complexity parameter and global constraints), it also indicates a web of connection hidden underneath complex systems even in non-ergodic regime, thereby generalising the previously known universality in complex systems in ergodic regime).\n.\nReferences\n\nP.

The sharpness of the interference that the quanton can produce is constrained by the distinguishability of the two paths. However there exist other kinds of quantum phenomena where interference of two-particle amplitudes results in a two-particle interference, if the particles are indistinguishable. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) effects are two well known examples. We will argue that the HOM and the HBT effects are not two distinct effects, as is usually believed. Instead there is a single phenomenon underlying both, which rests on the indistinguishability of particles, much the same way as single-particle interference rests on the indistinguishability of the two paths the particle takes. In fact, we will show that a duality relation, between particle distinguishability and the visibility of two-particle interference, can be derived.

An analytical variational ansatz allows us to obtain the phase diagrams of the superfluid and droplet phases. The crossover from the superfluid to the supersolid phase and to single and droplet arrays is probed with particle number and dipolar interaction. The dipolar strength is tuned by rotating the magnetic field with subsequent effects on phase boundaries. Following interaction quenches across the aforementioned phases, we monitor the dynamical formation of supersolid clusters or droplet lattices.\r\n\r\nRecent realization of binary dipolar BEC opens new exciting aspects for studying quantum droplets and supersolids in a binary mixture. Relying on the three-dimensional numerical simulations in the extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework, I discuss our findings of the groundstate phase diagrams and characterize different groundstate phases. The emergent phases include both miscible and immiscible single droplets (SD), multiple droplets (MD), supersolid (SS), and superfluid (SF) states. More intriguing mixed groundstates occur for an imbalanced binary mixture, including a combination of SS-SF, SS-MD, and SS-SS phases. Following linear quenches of intra-species scattering lengths across the aforementioned phases, I demonstrate the dynamical formation of supersolid clusters and droplet lattices.

Although in small quantum devices, the noise is assumed to be uncorrelated (Markovian) this assumption fails as the size and complexity increase, and the various system-environment interactions become correlated (non-Markovian).\nWe present a method of full quantum process tomography that captures non-Markovian noise and a method to detect quantum memory in a non-Markovian process [1]. We call a process Markovian when the environment does not provide a memory that retains correlations across different system-environment interactions. We define two types of non-Markovian processes, depending on the required memory being classical or quantum. We formalise this distinction using the process matrix formalism, through which a process is represented as a multipartite state. Within this formalism, a test for entanglement in the state can be mapped to a test for quantum memory in the process.\nWe demonstrate the method in a simple toy model, but our methods have been applied experimentally, too, in photonics [2] and superconducting qubits [3].\n[1] C.

A time crystal is a fascinating non-equilibrium phase of matter that exhibits spontaneous time translation-symmetry breaking. I will demonstrate that a many-body interference mechanism can be harnessed to create an eternal time crystal with global \"all-to-all\" interactions. In the second part of the talk, I will describe quantum information scrambling in a chaotic spin-chain with competing short and long-range interactions. I will argue that this system can exhibit fast scrambling, thereby providing a route to probe aspects of quantum gravity in near-term experiments. I will then briefly describe the kaleidoscope of quantum phases that emerge in this system and conclude with a a brief overview of future research directions.", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "Sayan Choudhury", "Name": "Dr. Sayan Choudhury", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "367", "Topic": "condensed matter theory"}, {"": "", "First Name": "Jasleen", "Surename": "Lugani", "Affiliation": "IIT Delhi", "Primary email": "jasleen.lugani@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "id": "99", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/22/2023", "Time ( IST )": "12:00:00", "Title": "", "Abstract": "", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "JasleenLugani", "Name": "Dr. Jasleen Lugani", "Link": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=3QdynOvt8O8", "Citations": "347", "Topic": ""}, {"": "", "First Name": "Flavio", "Surename": "Del Santo", "Affiliation": "University of Geneva", "Primary email": "Flavio.DelSanto@unige.ch", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "Before 2nd June", "Fixing Slot": "", "id": "100", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/19/2023", "Time ( IST )": "15:00:00", "Title": "Title: Potentialiy realism: Classical and quantum indeterminism", "Abstract": "Abstract: We propose an interpretation of physics named potential realism.

The Process Matrix Framework is one such framework that generalises quantum channels to process matrices. This framework has been vastly studied due to the direct applicability of known quantum information tools. Another framework, that chronologically preceded the process matrices is the Causaloid Framework which starts from a more general starting point and can be thought of as incorporating Generalised Probability Theories as well as Indefinite Causality. The Framework has been worked on more recently to be made more accessible. Further a hierarchy within the Causaloid Framework that is distinct from Sorkin's hierarchy, that depends on composition has been introduced. A natural question arises as to how the Process Matrix Formalism and the Causaloid Framework are related and how they can be understood through the introduced hierarchy. We answer this question by showing how the bipartite Process Matrices are a special instance in the Causaloid Framework. This work helps fill a theoretical gap in the literature and by understanding Indefinite Causality from the lens of Generalised Probability Theories helps us make attempts towards an axiomatic approach to Indefinite Causality.

However, sometimes it is not necessary to obtain an error-free outcome. Finding a good expectation value for an observable is often sufficient for many problems of interest in quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, combinatorial optimization, many-body physics etc. A set of methods, collectively called quantum error mitigation, has been studied to extract noise-free expectation values from a noisy device. In this talk, we shall go over a well-known and simple quantum error mitigation method, namely Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). While ZNE is treacherously simple in theory, it is often a challenge to work with it in real scenarios. We shall discuss the best practices for using ZNE and stress upon the importance of partial folding for larger circuits and its implementation method. Moreover, there are some types of noise for which ZNE does not provide any improvement - thus lowering its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We show that ZNE, when combined with measurement error mitigation and twirling, can overcome these shortcomings. We conclude by giving some insight into the choice of extrapolator and their effectiveness for this method.\n\nReference: R. Majumdar, P. Rivero, D. Wang.

However, the standard approach for implementing LCU requires a large number of ancilla qubits, as well as the ability to implement sophisticated controlled operations, leading to a large circuit depth. Thus, this broadly applicable quantum algorithmic paradigm is only useful for fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are decades away. In this talk, I will describe a randomized quantum algorithm that can implement any LCU by repeatedly sampling from a short-depth quantum circuit, and using only a single ancilla qubit. This algorithm can be run using early fault-tolerant quantum computers -- quantum devices that are expected to be available immediately after the current Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum stage, characterized by short circuit-depth and a limited number of logical qubits. I will apply this method to problems of wide applicability: estimation of the expectation value of any observable with respect to the ground states of Hamiltonians and the solution of quantum linear systems. This leads to novel quantum algorithms for these problems, which are less resource-demanding than the prior art, while remarkably, still retaining a provable quantum advantage. I will also briefly explore: (i) the possibility of implementing any LCU without any ancilla qubits and (ii) other intermediate-term quantum hardware possibilities that go beyond the circuit model and implement LCU using hybrid qubit-qumode systems. Overall, these techniques can be applied to develop quantum algorithms for several problems, with performance guarantees, tailored to intermediate-term quantum computers.", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "Shantanav Chakraborty", "Name": "Dr. Shantanav Chakraborty", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "", "Topic": ""}, {"": "", "First Name": "Kamanasish ", "Surename": "Debnath", "Affiliation": "\u00d8rsted", "Primary email": "kamanasish.debnath@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "id": "112", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/22/2023", "Time ( IST )": "10:00:00", "Title": "Dynamics of atomic ensembles coupled to an optical cavity", "Abstract": "The talk will focus on dynamics of atomic ensembles coupled to an optical cavity.

The thermodynamics no longer remains a concept based on ensemble average and the quantum properties of individual particles come to the forefront. In this talk, we will first redefine the various thermodynamic parameters in the quantum domain and then focus toward implementation of quantum thermal machines (QTM). We will discuss in detail about the implementation of different stages of a QTM, particularly an Otto engine, which interacts with two baths sequentially. It is often assumed that these baths can be switched on or off in a controlled manner which could be very challenging experimentally as the heat bath is always on at the quantum level.

The framework involves a system sequentially interacting with a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Such a simple-minded model of system-bath interaction has the potentiality of providing answers to several fundamental questions regarding the system's behavior. In the present talk, we will first discuss about the homogenization process of a system qubit when it sequentially interacts with the individual bath qubits via partial swap operations. We will then discuss about the homogenization process for the system qubit in the non-Markovian collisional model framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial swap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we will show that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states of the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario, where partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer. On the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than its Markovian counter part. Interestingly, a different choice of bath-bath unitary speeds up the homogenization process but loses the universality being dependent on the initial states of the bath units. In our process, we will show a regime of transition of non-Markovian dynamics to Markovian dynamics (and vice-versa).", "Show?": "show", "Image name": "", "Name": "Sibasish Ghosh", "Link": "", "Citations": "", "Topic": ""}]
