However, recently it has been shown [2,3] that this is just a standard quantum limit (SQL).\nThe Heisenberg limit \u2013\u2013 an achievable ultimate limit set by quantum mechanics for the task of producing a beam with the standard properties of a laser beam \u2013\u2013 is \u212d = O(\u03bc^4), a quadratic enhancement [2,3]. So far, proposals to demonstrate beyond-SQL scaling of \u212d have been limited to circuit QED, at microwave frequencies (i.e. a maser) [2,4]. Here we present the first optical- frequency laser platform that can surpass the Schawlow-Townes scaling: a super-radiant laser in the bad-cavity limit with feedback-controlled collective pumping. We show that the coherence can exhibit a scaling as large as \u212d ~ \u03bc^8/3, where here \u03bc \u2248 N/2, where N is the number of super-radiant atoms. Using atoms with an ultranarrow clock transition (mHz), we predict that a laser linewidth (the reciprocal of the coherence time) below 100 \u03bcHz could be attainable. This is more than an order of magnitude below standard super-radiant lasers, where the linewidth is limited to the transition width.\n[1] A. L. Schawlow and C. H.

The sharpness of the interference that the quanton can produce is constrained by the distinguishability of the two paths. However there exist other kinds of quantum phenomena where interference of two-particle amplitudes results in a two-particle interference, if the particles are indistinguishable. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) effects are two well known examples. We will argue that the HOM and the HBT effects are not two distinct effects, as is usually believed. Instead there is a single phenomenon underlying both, which rests on the indistinguishability of particles, much the same way as single-particle interference rests on the indistinguishability of the two paths the particle takes. In fact, we will show that a duality relation, between particle distinguishability and the visibility of two-particle interference, can be derived. The distinguishability of the two particles, arising from some internal degree of freedom, puts a bound on the sharpness of the two-particle interference they can produce, in a HOM or HBT kind of experiment."}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Andreas", "Surename": "Winter", "Affiliation": "Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona", "Primary email": "andreas.winter@uab.cat", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "week of 22 May", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "AndreasWinter", "Name": "Prof. Andreas Winter", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "22249", "Topic": "Quantum Information", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof. ", "First Name": "Gerardo", "Surename": "Adesso", "Affiliation": "University of Nottingham", "Primary email": "gerardo.adesso@nottingham.ac.uk", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "May 15 or the week starting June 12", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "GerardoAdesso", "Name": "Prof.  Gerardo Adesso", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "18264", "Topic": "Quantum information", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Lorenzo", "Surename": "Maccone", "Affiliation": "University of Pavia", "Primary email": "Lmaccone@qubit.it", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "May 22 and June 9", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "LorenzoMaccone", "Name": "Prof. Lorenzo Maccone", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "16446", "Topic": "Quantum Foundation", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Markus", "Surename": "Huber", "Affiliation": "University of Vienna", "Primary email": "marcus.huber@univie.ac.at", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "MarkusHuber", "Name": "Prof. Markus Huber", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "", "Topic": "Quantum information", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Dieter ", "Surename": "Suter", "Affiliation": "Dortmund University", "Primary email": "dieter.suter@tu-dortmund.de", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "Dieter Suter", "Name": "Prof. Dieter  Suter", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "", "Topic": "Quantum computing", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Ujjwal", "Surename": "Sen", "Affiliation": "HRI, Allahabad", "Primary email": "ujjwal@hri.res.in", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/10/2023", "Time ( IST )": "10:00:00", "UTC": "", "Image name": "UjjwalSen", "Name": "Prof. Ujjwal Sen", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "6618", "Topic": "Quantum information", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Jonathan", "Surename": "Oppenheim", "Affiliation": "University College London", "Primary email": "j.oppenheim@ucl.ac.uk", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "2nd week of May, not around May 18-20", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/11/2023", "Time ( IST )": "15:00:00", "UTC": "", "Image name": "JonathanOppenheim", "Name": "Prof. Jonathan Oppenheim", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "9720", "Topic": "Quantum information", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Gilad", "Surename": "Gour", "Affiliation": "University of Calgary", "Primary email": "giladgour@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "GiladGour", "Name": "Prof. Gilad Gour", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "6472", "Topic": "Quantum Information", "Title": "", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof. ", "First Name": "Kwek Leong", "Surename": "Chuan", "Affiliation": "CQT, Natl Univ. of Singapore", "Primary email": "\tcqtklc@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/12/2023", "Time ( IST )": "10:00:00", "UTC": "", "Image name": "Kwek LeongChuan", "Name": "Prof.  Kwek Leong Chuan", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "10926", "Topic": "Quantum information", "Title": "Title of the talk: Classical and Quantum Neural Networks and the Effort towards Chip-Based Technology.", "Abstract": "Abstract: Classical neural network has been in existence for many decades, and with the advent of quantum information. there is a recent revival in quantum neural network.

However, many experiments admit effective descriptions in terms of other state spaces, such as classical probability distributions or quantum systems with superselection rules. Here, we ask which probabilistic theories could reasonably be found as effective descriptions of physical systems if nature is fundamentally quantum. To this end, we employ a generalized version of noncontextuality: processes that are statistically indistinguishable in an effective theory should not require explanation by multiple distinguishable processes in a more fundamental theory. We formulate this principle in terms of embeddings and simulations of one probabilistic theory by another, show how this concept subsumes standard notions of contextuality, and prove a multitude of fundamental results on the exact and approximate embedding of theories (in particular into quantum theory). We show how results on Bell inequalities can be used for the robust certification of this generalized notion of contextuality. From this, we propose an experimental test of quantum theory by probing single physical systems without assuming access to a tomographically complete set of procedures, arguably avoiding a significant loophole of earlier approaches.\r\n\r\nBased on joint work with Andrew J.

Physical systems can however be complex in nature and it is not always possible to determine the operator exactly or, even if they are known, to solve the equations they determine.\nThe complexity of a system e.g one with many body interactions, in general, makes it difficult to determine some or almost all matrix elements (even in absence of disorder). The lack of accuracy acts as a source of randomness for the matrix elements and it can be modeled by a random matrix (with some or all random entries). While the statistical behavior of many body systems in ergodic regime can be well-modeled by the stationary random matrix ensembles, the non-ergodic regime requires consideration of system-dependent random matrix ensembles: those which can take into account the physical constraints on the system e.g. local interactions, dimensionality, symmetry, local conservation laws. For example, the combined effect of nearest neighbor interactions and dimensionality can lead to a sparse random matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a basis of interest, with sparsity and nature of randomness dependent on system-specific details.\nThe statistical analysis of various many body systems requires, therefore, a thorough probing of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles which is not an easy task. The theoretical analysis is further complicated by the fluctuation of accuracy due to varying system conditions causing multi parametric evolution of the matrix elements. Fortunately we are able to show that, for single-well potentials, it is possible to identify a function of all distribution parameters, seemingly a measure of average uncertainty and therefore referred as the complexity parameter, in terms of which the multi-parametric evolution can be reduced to a single parametric one. As a consequence, the evolution of the statistical properties of a wide range of system-dependent random matrix ensembles can be described by a common mathematical formulation where system information enters through the complexity parameter only. This in turn suggests a possible classification of complex systems in an infinite range of universality classes characterized just by the complexity parameter and the nature of global physical constraints e.g. symmetries and conservation laws. The complexity parametric formulation of the statistical properties not only helps in technical simplification (one can apply results available for one complex system to another if they have same complexity parameter and global constraints), it also indicates a web of connection hidden underneath complex systems even in non-ergodic regime, thereby generalising the previously known universality in complex systems in ergodic regime).\n.\nReferences\n\nP.

We propose an interpretation of physics named potential realism. This view, which can be applied to classical as well as to quantum physics, regards potentialities (i.e. intrinsic, objective propensities for individual events to obtain) as elements of reality. This allows one to naturally reconcile realism and fundamental indeterminism in any theoretical framework. We discuss our specific interpretation of propensities, that require them to depart from being probabilities at the formal level, though allowing for statistics and the law of large numbers. This view helps reconcile classical and quantum physics by showing that most of the conceptual problems that are customarily taken to be unique issues of the latter \u2013such as the measurement problem\u2013, are actually in common to all indeterministic physical theories."}, {"Designation": "Dr.", "First Name": "Subimal", "Surename": "Deb", "Affiliation": "C-Dac Kolkata", "Primary email": "subimal.deb@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "SubimalDeb", "Name": "Dr. Subimal Deb", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "248", "Topic": "", "Title": "Subimal", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Dr.", "First Name": "Nitica", "Surename": "Sakharwade", "Affiliation": "ICTQT, University of Gdnask", "Primary email": "nitica.sakharwade@ug.edu.pl", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": " May 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "NiticaSakharwade", "Name": "Dr. Nitica Sakharwade", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "34", "Topic": "Quantum foundation , causality ", "Title": "Nitica", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Dr.", "First Name": "Suranjana", "Surename": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "IIT Patna", "Primary email": "suranjana.ghosh15@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "", "Time ( IST )": "", "UTC": "", "Image name": "SuranjanaGhosh", "Name": "Dr. Suranjana Ghosh", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "241", "Topic": "Nonlinear dynamics", "Title": "Suranjana", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Prof.", "First Name": "Aradhya", "Surename": "Shukla", "Affiliation": "GLA University, Mathura", "Primary email": "ashukla038@gmail.com", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/17/2023", "Time ( IST )": "11:00:00", "UTC": "", "Image name": "AradhyaShukla", "Name": "Prof. Aradhya Shukla", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "230", "Topic": "HEP", "Title": "Aradhya", "Abstract": ""}, {"Designation": "Dr.", "First Name": "Ritabrata", "Surename": "Sengupta", "Affiliation": "IISER Berhampur", "Primary email": "rb@iiserbpr.ac.in", "Response": "Accepted", "Schedule": "", "": "", "Fixing Slot": "", "Date (double click to pick)": "5/15/2023", "Time ( IST )": "11:00:00", "UTC": "", "Image name": "RitabrataSengupta", "Name": "Dr. Ritabrata Sengupta", "Link": "https://www.youtube.com/@QIQT", "Citations": "226", "Topic": "Quantum Information", "Title": "Title of the talk: Conditions for local transformations between sets of quantum states.", "Abstract": "Abstract: We study the problem of transforming a set of pure bipartite states into another using deterministic LOCC (local operations and classical communication).

However, the standard approach for implementing LCU requires a large number of ancilla qubits, as well as the ability to implement sophisticated controlled operations, leading to a large circuit depth. Thus, this broadly applicable quantum algorithmic paradigm is only useful for fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are decades away. In this talk, I will describe a randomized quantum algorithm that can implement any LCU by repeatedly sampling from a short-depth quantum circuit, and using only a single ancilla qubit. This algorithm can be run using early fault-tolerant quantum computers -- quantum devices that are expected to be available immediately after the current Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum stage, characterized by short circuit-depth and a limited number of logical qubits. I will apply this method to problems of wide applicability: estimation of the expectation value of any observable with respect to the ground states of Hamiltonians and the solution of quantum linear systems. This leads to novel quantum algorithms for these problems, which are less resource-demanding than the prior art, while remarkably, still retaining a provable quantum advantage. I will also briefly explore: (i) the possibility of implementing any LCU without any ancilla qubits and (ii) other intermediate-term quantum hardware possibilities that go beyond the circuit model and implement LCU using hybrid qubit-qumode systems. Overall, these techniques can be applied to develop quantum algorithms for several problems, with performance guarantees, tailored to intermediate-term quantum computers."}]
